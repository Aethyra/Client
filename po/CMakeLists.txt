GETTEXT_CREATE_TRANSLATIONS(aethyra.pot ${POFILES})
# This is an ugly hack to enable building of translations with
# the default target due to a bug in GETTEXT_CREATE_TRANSLATIONS.
# The bug has been fixed in recent CMake 2.6.3. Once 2.6.3 is widely
# deployed the above line should be changed to:
# GETTEXT_CREATE_TRANSLATIONS(aethyra.pot ALL ${POFILES}) 
# and the following two lines removed
