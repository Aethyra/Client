Description:  Aethyra is a community driven experiment that utilizes eAthena at its core with the end goal of 
 getting its players as involved in the process as much as possible. It's originally forked from 
 The Mana World when its developers came up with the idea of "Why should we have to wait for an 
 MMORPG game in development when we've already got a great server setup here that does everything 
 we've been promised and more?" As such, we are trying to implement as many functions of eAthena 
 as possible while creating our own in the process based on what our players want to see.
