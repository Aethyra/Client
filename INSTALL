1. Requirements
===============

You are expected to have either checked out Aethyra from git or you have downloaded
a source release. To get Aethyra to compile, you need a compiler
(GCC) and some libraries. The required libraries are:

* SDL               http://www.libsdl.org/
* SDL_gfx           http://www.ferzkopp.net/%7Easchiffler/Software/SDL_gfx-2.0/index.html
* SDL_image         http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
* SDL_mixer         http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
* SDL_net           http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/
* SDL_ttf           http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
* Guichan 0.8.x     http://guichan.sourceforge.net/
* libxml2           http://www.xmlsoft.org/
* physfs 1.0.x      http://icculus.org/physfs/
* zlib 1.2.x        http://www.gzip.org/zlib/
* libcurl           http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/

If you cloned Aethyra from the Git repository, you will also need these tools to
compile:

* GNU automake 1.9  http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/
* GNU autoconf      http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/
* GNU gettext       http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/
* CVS               http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/ (needed to run autopoint)

On some machines, it's been reported that this package is also needed. However,
you might not need it:

* GNU libtool       http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/

Installing these dependencies is distributions-specific, and we'll leave it to
you to figure this out.


2. Compiling And Installing Aethyra
===============================================

1) Go to the directory you have extracted the source to.
2) If you've cloned the Git repository, run "autoreconf -i" to generate
   configure and install any missing auxiliary files.
3) Run "./configure"
4) Run "make"
5) Run "make install" as root

It should have installed Aethyra on your system now, and you can
run it with "aethyra". By default all files are installed to /usr/local, you can
pass a different prefix to configure as usual.

    NOTE: if the autobuild.sh fails 
	1.) autoreconf -i
	2.) ./configure
	3.) make
	4.) su -c "make install"

	you can get help from A.) IRC channel  irc.freenode.net #aedev or #aethyra
			      B.) http://www.aethyra.com/forums/
	Make sure you record the output from the konsole window

  NOTE: It is possible to compile Aethyra without support for OpenGL rendering.
  To do this perform step 3 as follows:

    ./configure --without-opengl

  Rebuild the executable from scratch using "make clean" and then "make".
